Definition:
  # Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where adjacent elements are repeatedly 
compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. 
  # With each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" 
to its correct position at the end of the array. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Example: There are 4 elements in the array,
  We need to sort that in a way that should be arranged in some sort of order(ascending)

Create 2 loops :
  #Outer loop = The arr entry pass and the parameter range
  #Inner loop = The range of iteration after every pass  
                The condition of i+1 larger/smaller
                The swapping task
Finally, print the arr
