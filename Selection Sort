Sorting Algorithm - Selection Sort
Two Types of Sorting :
1.Sorted - Increasing (ascending)order
  eg: 1,5,7,9,12,15
2.Unsorted - Decreasing (descending)order
  eg: 14,12,7,9,5,1

# Purpose:
Create a solution to sort the given(6,8,2,7,1,5,3) set of numbers either in ascending or descending order


SELECTION SORTING:
*Defines -- choosing the right element in the right position (first, second position)
Problem:  [68,25,71,43,5]

Step1 : Fixing the first value as a "i"
Step2 : Comparing the Second value, if its lesser than first value
Step3 : By denoting the elements via index and put it as "i+1".
Step4 : Other than the first or current poisiton it can be named as "j"
